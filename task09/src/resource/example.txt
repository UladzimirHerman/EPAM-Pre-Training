What is method overloading in Java?
Method overloading in Java is a programming concept when programmer declares two methods of the same name but with different method signature, for example, change in the argument list or change in the type of argument.
Method overloading is a powerful Java programming technique to declare a method which does a similar performance but with a different kind of input.
One of the most popular examples of method overloading is System out println method which is overloaded to accept all kinds of data types in Java.
You have println method which takes String, int, float, double or char in output.
All of those methods are collectively referred as an overloaded method in Java.
